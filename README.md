Hello everyone. This is a mini project on machine learning model that predicts things based on its past data.In this prediction we used Quality of wine dataset to predict the QUALITY OF WINE. predict  quality of wine we need to follow some stped 
  1.Getting the dataset
  2.Importing libraries
  3.Importing datasets
  4.Finding Missing Data
  5.Encoding Categorical Data
  6.Splitting dataset into training and test set
  7.Feature scaling
we used to do all these things for prediction of a given data set.
